# Fibonacci-
Python scripts for Fibonacci recursive formula

the are 3 scripts scripts:
- the first is a base, non optimized, version of the  Fibonacci recursive sequence
-  the second script is an optimized version of the Fibonacci sequence using the concept of Memoization in Python where I will cache the values of the sequence into a dictonary for better access them and sped-up the programm for bigger n
- this script will use Memoization too, but a python module is used
